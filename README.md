# Fullscreen Overlay with multiple buttons and datasets
The <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/02/06/fullscreen-overlay-effects">Fullscreen Overlay Effects'</a> by Mary Lou at CODROPS is really simple and creative and useful and awesome. Recently, some people asked how to set multiple links and different overlays in the same page, so I tried and finally got it. I hope it can be helpfull!
